What's Different
================

This repo, bitcore-p2p-crown, is based on the `7bb9afd416ee0033afd3a06bcc3afc151f27fc11` commit of the official bitcore-p2p. Network magic has been adjusted. The file "integration/bitcoind.js" seems completely useless, but is still kept.

The following is the original contributing guide of bitcore-lib.
